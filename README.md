# Heisse Preise
A terrible grocery price search "app". Fetches data from big Austrian grocery chains daily and lets you search them. See https://heisse-preise.io.

You can also get the [raw data](https://heisse-preise.io/api/index). The raw data is returned as a JSON array of items. An item has the following fields:

* `store`: (`billa`, `spar`, `hofer`, `dm`, `lidl`, `mpreis`)
* `name`: the product name.
* `price`: the current price in â‚¬.
* `priceHistory`: an array of `{ date: "yyyy-mm-dd", price: number }` objects, sorted in descending order of date.
* `unit`: unit the product is sold at. May be undefined.
* `bio`: whether this product is classified as organic/"Bio"

The project consists of a trivial NodeJS Express server responsible for fetching the product data, massaging it, and serving it to the front end (see `index.js`). The front end is a least-effort vanilla HTML/JS search form (see sources in `site/`).

## Run via NodeJS
Install NodeJS, then run this in a shell of your choice.

```
git clone https://github.com/badlogic/heissepreise
cd heissepreise
npm install
node index.js
```

The first time you run this, the data needs to be fetched from the stores. You should see log out put like this.

Example app listening on port 3000
```

Once the app is listening per default on port 3000, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.\
**Note**: If you want to start on a different port add it as the third parameter, e.g. `node index.js 3001` will map to port `3001`.

Subsequent starts will fetch the data asynchronously, so you can start working immediately.

## Docker
The project has a somewhat peculiar Docker Compose setup tailored to my infrastructure. All compose config files are in `docker/` including a simple Bash script to start and interact with the containers. This is the setup I use for both development and deployment.

For development, run `docker/control.sh startdev`. You can connect to both the NodeJS server and the client for debugging in Visual Studio code via the `client-server` launch configuration (found in `.vscode/launch.json`).

For production, run `docker/control.sh start`.

## Generating a self-contained executable
 Run the `package.sh`script in a Bash shell. It will generate a folder `dist/` with executable for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Run the executable for your OS.
